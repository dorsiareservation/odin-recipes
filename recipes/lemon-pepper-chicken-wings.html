    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>We love lemon-pepper wings, especially during football season. 
        I got tired of spending so much money on them that I decided to whip up my own version 
        of Wingstop's lemon-pepper chicken wings. 
        The end result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.
    </p>    

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>12 chicken wings</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>     
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir olive oil and lemon-pepper seasoning together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Toss hot wings with lemon-pepper mixture to coat.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
